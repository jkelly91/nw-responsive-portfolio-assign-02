# nw-responsive-portfolio-assign-02

## Description

A web and mobile responsive portfolio about me and my journey so far in the bootcamp program.

I learned a lot doing this process, I spent a lot of hours on this too, roughly over 30 hours or more..

I still can't seem to figure out why fonts abd responsiveness looks different on live server and default browser than it does
on github.
